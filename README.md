# Overview
Many players have used social media to voice their opinions on serious social injustice issues over the years, but 2020 in particular has given rise to an enormous amount of politically charged inequity. With that, there has been an increase in tweets made by NBA players about these issues and we wanted to find a correlation between the amount of political tweets and its effect on their salary, on-court performance and overall impact to the team.To accomplish this, we used two different datasets: one that reports all NBA players’ performance statistics and the other that reports the most recent 3000 tweets from those players with active twitter accounts. We then took the twitter dataset and performed a text analysis to find words relating to politics and/or social injustice, in order to parse the political tweets from the non-political tweets. We found that there is no statiscally significant correlation between the political tweet, retweet, and favorite proportion, and a player’s on-court performance, salary and impact to the team most of the time during 2017-2021.

# Research Question
How does the number, favorite count, and retweet count of NBA players' political tweets affect their salary, on-court performance, and impact to the team during 2017-2021?
