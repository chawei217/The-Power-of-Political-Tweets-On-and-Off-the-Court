# Overview
Many players have used social media to voice their opinions on serious social injustice issues over the years, but 2020 in particular has given rise to an enormous amount of politically charged inequity. With that, there has been an increase in tweets made by NBA players about these issues and we wanted to find a correlation between the amount of political tweets and its effect on their salary, on-court performance and overall impact to the team.To accomplish this, we used two different datasets: one that reports all NBA players’ performance statistics and the other that reports the most recent 3000 tweets from those players with active twitter accounts. We then took the twitter dataset and performed a text analysis to find words relating to politics and/or social injustice, in order to parse the political tweets from the non-political tweets. We found that there is no statiscally significant correlation between the political tweet, retweet, and favorite proportion, and a player’s on-court performance, salary and impact to the team most of the time during 2017-2021.

# Research Question
How does the number, favorite count, and retweet count of NBA players' political tweets affect their salary, on-court performance, and impact to the team during 2017-2021?

# Conclusion & Discussion
After an extensive data collection, cleaning, and analysis, we have come to the conclusion that in concurrence with our hypothesis, there is no direct correlation between the political tweet, retweet, and favorite proportion, and a player’s on-court performance, salary and impact to the team most of the time during 2017-2021. However, in terms of political's tweet's contribution to the team's success, there is some instances such as the relationship between favorite proporition and team winning percentage in 2020-21 which proved statiscally significant. A further step of the project will be to have a deeper dive into the favorite proportion of the tweets. For example, we might want to investigate what teams in particular is more indicative of this relationship, and if this team is more politically active compared to the previous years.

Player-wise, while there were 709 players with twitter accounts, and around 350 of them having non-zero percentage of politically relevant tweets, our data still showed that we might not have enough data for our analysis. We observed this shortcoming when there was not a statiscally significant relationship for political proportion for any of the seasons from 2017-2021, but a statiscally significant relationship when we looked at the aggregate of the seasons.

Some interesting thing we noticed is that there was a spike in political tweets, retweets, and favorites during 2020 and those tweets did reflect a common theme of political activism surrounding the black lives matter movement and police brutality, which showcased our classifers did capture the heightend political climate during 2020.
